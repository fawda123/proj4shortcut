# proj4shortcut
R package with easy to remember names for many commonly used proj4strings.  

The goal for `proj4shortcut` is that it will be community developed and the shortcuts that are added are useful for that community. 

As May 2017, the details of contributing shortcuts are still being finalized, but the rough outline in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) should be adequate.
